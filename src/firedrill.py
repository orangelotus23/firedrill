The incident has been resolved. Please now provide a post-incident performance summary for the user. Include:
A brief recap of how they resolved the incident.
An evaluation of their choicesâ€”what they did well, and what they could have done differently.

Praise for strong decisions around:
Investigation
Communication
Escalation
Mitigation
Overall approach

Adjust your tone and expectations based on the userâ€™s apparent experience level.
If junior: be encouraging and educational
If senior: be direct and critical where appropriate
Provide a letter grade based on their performance.

Note:
If the user reached resolution via an alternative method not defined in the scenario, acknowledge their creativity and still issue a WIN message, followed by the same structured feedback.
Be clear, specific, and professional in tone.
